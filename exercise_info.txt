Bicep Curl:
    Should only see gyroscope for z axis.
        Positive gz means curling into self, Negative gz means straightening arm.
        Use gz for speed of bicep curl, use gx and gy for bad form.
    Accelerometer for orientation
        Arm should only be moving along ax and az.
        High ax and low az at start
        Low ax and high az at top of curl

Lateral Raises:
    Accelerometer
        ax near -1 at bottom, and near 0.5-0.4 at top
        ay near -0.3 at bottom, and near 0 at top
        az near 0 at bottom and near 1 at top

    gyroscope
        gx is < 35 going up, and > -50 going down
        gy is > -100 going up, and < 100 going down
        gz is within 50 magnitude

Bent-over Row:
    Accelerometer
        ax near -1 at bottom, and near -1 at top
        ay near near 0 (negative) at bottom, and near -0.3 at top
        az near 0.25 at bottom and near 0.5 at top

    gyroscope
        gx is near 0
        gy is less than 30 magnitude
        gz is less than 40 magnitude

Jumping Jacks:
    Should only use gyroscope for y axis.
        Positive gy for arm going up, negative gy for arm going down
    Accelerometer for orientation: only ax and ay should change?
        Arms should mostly move along ax and ay.
        Low ax at top, High ax at standing.
        Low ay in middle of arm swing, high ay at top and bottom of arm swing.

Sit-ups (palms flat on ground):
    Should only use gyroscope for x axis.
        Positive gx for sitting up, negative gx for lying back down
    Accelerometer for orientation:
        Accelerometer should only see major change along x axis.
        ax increases sitting up and decreases sitting down
        ax should never be negative

Ab-crunches:
    Accelerometer
        ax near -0.6 at bottom, and near 0 (positive) at top
        ay near 0.8 at bottom, and near near 1 at top
        az near -0.25 at bottom and near 0.5 at top

    gyroscope
        gx is less than 110 mag
        gy is less than 110 mag
        gz is less than 100 mag
 
Push-ups:
    Accelerometer
        ax near 0.25 at bottom, and near -0.1 at top
        ay near 0 at bottom, and near 0 at top
        az near -1 at bottom and near -1 at top

    gyroscope
        gx is less than 20 mag
        gy is less than 30 mag
        gz is less than 10 mag
